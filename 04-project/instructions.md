Now, let's begin the ultimate challenge. Following our instructions, you’re going to code your way into your own landing page!
Please, wait for us to create the necessary files inside a new folder in your computer, then go through the questions as usual and follow the instructions by typing real code in your favourite text editor.

- You will deal with 4 files inside a folder that represents the project: `index.html`, `contact.html`, `style.css` and `script.js`. Add the basic HTML structure into `index.html`.
- Link `style.css` to `index.html`.
- Using an appropriate HTML tag, create 3 empty sections in `index.html` with the class _‘section’_.
- Inside the first section, add a title with your name, a paragraph with a sentence of your choice, and a picture of you (or of a cute internet kitten).
- Inside the second section, add a list of your favourite movies, hobbies, or foods.
- In the last section type the necessary code to link `index.html` with `contact.html`. Display the link with the text _‘Contact me’_.
- Add the class _‘text-orange’_ to the link.
- In the CSS file, add the following properties to the class selector _‘section’_: margin, max-width. Set their values in order to display them in the center of the web page.
- Write the CSS code necessary to give the class _‘text-orange’_ the property that would change the color of the text to a nice orange.
- Add the class _‘button-big’_ to the HTML of the button.
- Write some CSS rules for the class _‘button-big’_ in order to style a noticeable call to action (HINT: play with padding, the radius of the borders, the color of the background, text-align and display properties…)
- Add basic HTML structure to `contact.html` and, inside the body tags, add two empty sections like the ones of index.html.
- Add an `<h1>` with your email address in the first section and add a link to go back to `index.html` in the second and last section.
- Link `script.js` to `index.html`.
- Make sure the script is linked by _console logging ‘Hello, world!’_. Where would you look for this message in the browser?
- Add the id _‘list-fav’_ to the second section on _index.html_.
- In `script.js`, below `console.log(‘Hello, world!’)`, add the code necessary to select the element with the id _‘list-fav’_, and toggle on it the class _‘text-orange’_ when you click on it.
