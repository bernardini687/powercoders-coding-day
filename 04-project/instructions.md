Now, let's begin the ultimate challenge. Following our instructions, you’re going to code your way into your own landing page! Please, wait for us to create the necessary files inside a new folder in your computer, then go through the questions as usual and follow the instructions by typing real code in your favourite text editor. For each of the questions, you’re going to copy the code you’ve written in your local files and paste it into the answer fields of the questionnaire.
